- NOW get the features about vehicles 
  
  CLOCK: [2023-04-06 Thu 11:23:47]
	- think about the ways to compute the features
	- compile the code to process the data(2022.1-2022.10)
	- output the result data
	- start to hive off with the clusters and estimate the group result
	-
- NOW learn the Logseq with book and page #Logseq应用

  CLOCK: [2023-04-06 Thu 10:28:55]
	- read the book [第二大脑](https://www.dedao.cn/ebook/reader?id=pqvNQ1KRJa7EmgG8MPKrzykNVbDpBWZoYp3QA1xO54nlvZq296YodejLXVJE5eAd) to learn how to use the Logseq
	- use Logseq to write the daily log
- LATER write the computational logic about the features of 车辆行驶安全风险评估模型&区段驾驶安全风险模型
	- 车辆行驶安全风险评估模型
	- 区段驾驶安全风险模型
